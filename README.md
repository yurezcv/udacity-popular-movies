# Popular Movies

The Popular Movies project for Udacity Android Nanodegree.
My attempt on developing the project by using Clean Architecture principles and patterns (MVP and Repository)

## Built With

* [Picasso](https://square.github.io/picasso/) - A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android
* [gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - A Java serialization/deserialization library to convert Java Objects into JSON and back
* [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) - An HTTP & HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java

## Acknowledgments

A lot of inspiration was taken from Google Samples of [Android Architecture Blueprints](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp-clean/)
