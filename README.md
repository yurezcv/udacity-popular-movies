# Popular Movies

The Popular Movies project for Udacity Android Nanodegree.
My attempt on developing the project by using Clean Architecture principles and patterns (MVP and Repository)

### Other features

* Show a detailed Activity with information, trailers and reviews about the selected movie;
* Add movies to favorites;
* See a grid of favorite movies;
* Watch trailers in a YouTube app (if installed) or in a web browser;
* Share a movie trailer;
